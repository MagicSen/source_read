        "The robot gets a reward (positive value) or a cost (negative value) when moving to a new cell. The purpose of the game is for the robot to figure out how to move from the start to goal position and getting as much reward (or as little cost) as possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each cell in the grid world have different functions:\n",
        "* **SPACE**: The robot is free to enter this cell, but there is a at a certain cost for doing so (e.g. -1).\n",
        "* **START**: This is where the robot starts, like SPACE it can also be entered (returned to), at a cost. A maze must only have one START cell.\n",
        "* **GOAL**: The robot successfully solves the maze and typically gets a reward by walking to this cell. A maze can have more than one goal cell.\n",
        "* **WALL**: This cell cannot be entered.\n",
        "* **BOUNCE**: The robot can attempt to enter this cell, but doing so will make it bounce back to the cell it came from, and get the associated reward/cost of that cell.\n",
        "* **HOLE**: The robot enters this cell at a typically big cost, and the game is over. In other words, it fails to reach the GOAL cell.\n",
        "\n",

        "* The goal cell is at [4,4]. Entering this cell gives the robot 10 in reward, and the robot has successfully solve the maze (the T menas terminal cell).\n",
        "* Entering the hole in [2,2] will cost the robot -100 and it is a terminal state (game over). Since robot did not reach goal cell, it lost. Likewise for the hole at [3,4].\n",
        "* Entering one of the space cells at position [2,3] and [3,2] each has a cost of -2.\n",
        "* The space cell at [4,0] is a bit special. Since the cell at [4,5] is also space, it means the robot can go left in [4,0] and end up in [4,5]. Had [4,5] been a wall, going left from [4,0] would not have been a legal action.\n",
        "* Cell [4,2] is a bounce cell. This means attempting to enter it from [3,2], [4,1], or [4,3] results in robot bouncing back to those cells. Cost will be -2 from [3,2] and -1 from [4,1] and [4,3].\n",
